JDBC App - Optional part

Using JavaFaker, I've generated data and populated my tables
+ Created a table named Chart in the MusicAlbums Database, which contains all the artists and a
randomly generated "popularity number" for each of them (artist_id being FK)
Artist, Album and Chart classes are object-oriented representations of the tables from the database
ChartController prepares a list of artists, ordered by their popularity number, which will be then
displayed by the Main class

*I have also generated a HTML report (at any given path) containing the chart, using Apache FreeMarker, 
after creating a template which loops through all the artists found in the list generated by the 
ChartController and displays their name and their rank
Note: Output.PNG illustrates what happens at runtime. There's also a HTMLFormattedReport.html example
and a screenshot of it
