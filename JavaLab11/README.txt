REST Services

Created a Spring Boot project using Initializr (added rest & jdbc dependencies)
+ created 2 more tables in the database: Player(id, name) and Game(id, player1_id, player2_id)
+ created a PlayerController class - which manages the requests by calling different
methods from the PlayersRepo
